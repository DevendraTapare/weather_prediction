# Rain Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow (RainTomorrow) based on weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological factors. The dataset includes historical weather data, and the target is to classify whether it will rain (Yes) or not (No) on the next day.

## Project Workflow
1. Problem Statement: Defining the goal of predicting rainfall using meteorological data.
2. Data Gathering: Importing and processing historical weather data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to uncover trends, relationships, and patterns.
4. Feature Engineering: Preparing the data for model training by creating and transforming features.
5. Model Development: Implementing and evaluating classification algorithms.
6. Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Key Features
* Dataset: Includes weather attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and cloud cover.
* EDA: Insights into trends and correlations in the weather data.
* Machine Learning: Supervised learning techniques to classify rainfall occurrence.
## Technologies Used
* Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) in your Python environment.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.
## Future Enhancements
* Incorporating additional meteorological data for improved predictions.
* Implementing advanced machine learning models like ensemble techniques.
